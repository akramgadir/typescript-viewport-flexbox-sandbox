# Viewport Grid

## Task

Develop a single-page application featuring a consistent grid of viewports, accompanied by a static sidebar. This sidebar should offer "Rows" and "Columns" as input fields, each accepting values ranging from 1 to 10, alongside a toggle button for collapsing or expanding the sidebar. The grid should accurately display the specified number of "Rows" and "Columns," positioning a viewport in each grid cell. It's essential for the grid to occupy the available space, evenly distributing all viewports with a modest separation between them, and to dynamically adjust in response to changes in browser size or the state of the sidebar. Each viewport should be outlined with a slender border and constantly monitor its dimensions, displaying them centrally. While the provided color scheme is a guideline, the overall design should be fine-tuned for a sleek, contemporary user experience.
